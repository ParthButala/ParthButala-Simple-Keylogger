# ParthButala-Simple-Keylogger
Overview:
The Simple Keylogger program captures and records keystrokes in real time, logging each entry with a precise timestamp. All captured data is stored in a file for future analysis. While demonstrating the technical skills required for keystroke logging, the program strongly emphasizes the ethical responsibilities tied to its use.

Key Features:
Keystroke Logging:
Logs every keystroke, including special characters, along with a timestamp for accurate tracking.

File Logging:

Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Designed to run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it adaptable to various systems.

Ethical Focus:
The project underscores the importance of ethical practices, ensuring that keylogging is only used with proper consent and within legal boundaries.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pynput Library (pip install pynput): A library used to monitor and control keyboard input in real time.
Ethical Considerations:
Keylogging has significant ethical and privacy implications. It is vital that this tool is used only with explicit consent from all parties involved. Users must adhere to legal regulations and ethical guidelines to protect privacy and prevent unauthorized monitoring.
